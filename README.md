## Mine Sweeper Game

#### This simple project utilizes Java 16 and Swing Toolkit.
#### It uses the observer pattern wich defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all of its dependents are notified and updated automatically. This makes the MineSweeper game easier to make and maintain and also faster to run.

#### To run the game, you will need Java 16. Them simply run the *TelaPrincipal.java* file, in the frontend folder.
